Summary

Brownian dynamics with dWLC model
OK for long DNA (not by MD)
good under confinement (not by bead-spring model)

reproduce the existing results
diffusion constant at equilibrium
radius of gyration (end-to-end distance)
extension in confinement

simple EP/EO model
size dependence on mobility
