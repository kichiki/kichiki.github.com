Overview

1) prepare configurations  
for each  
(periodic B.C., random hard-core)
2) solve the Stokes equation

    for (F, T, E) problems

(Mo-Sangani, 1994)   

3) take the ensemble averaging

4) apply the closure procedure

Note:
step 2) is the most time-consuming part
step 3) can be done without re-doing step 2)

Re = 0, Pe = ∞
truncate at 5th order of the moments
