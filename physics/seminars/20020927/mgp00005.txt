Stokesian Dynamics

               
: far field effect
from the expansion with F, T, S
: near field effect (lubrication correction)
from the 2-body EXACT solution

Questions:
formulations are done up to FTS approximation
beyond FTS [Q1]
matrix-inversion takes many-body effect
no proof [Q2]
lubrication correction	
how accurate (inaccurate)? [Q3]
