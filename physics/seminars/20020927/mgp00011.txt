4. Conclusions and Discussions

Conclusions
Give the answers on Stokesian Dynamics
[A1] higher version is formulated
[A2] taking all reflections and matrix-inversion is equivalent
[A3] lubrication becomes worse for larg N
Obtain O(N) scheme using FMM

Discussions (future works)
To make the MODEL
using the particle-particle interaction
Applications of the simple FMM for other problems
vortices
elastic problem
