4. Conclusions

Statistical Method:
Formulate and Implement the Method
Demonstrate for Linear Sinsoidal Non-Uniformity

In the future work,
More complicated non-uniformity (step, void, etc.)
Higher correlation (pair-distribution, etc)

Constitutive Relations:




In the future work,
Higher orders in k
Interphase Force and Torque
