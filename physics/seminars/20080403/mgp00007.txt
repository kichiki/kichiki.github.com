3. Basic Theory - Zeta Potential


[Masliyah, Bhattacharjee (2006)]   
Problem - finite size of ions


Stern layer
where immobile ions are stuck at the surface
Zeta potential
the potential at which the no-slip B.C. is applied
(= shear plane)

Note: zeta potential is
a general (phenomenological) parameter
characterizing the surface properties
both physically and chemically
